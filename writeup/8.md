### Day 8 

#### Part 1

Put the network nodes into a map/dictionary, for the ease of looking up the next target every time. Organize the steps into an array so it can be repeated. Follow the instruction, count the steps and stop until ZZZ is reached.

I found no special rule here to skip instruction sets, taking the steps one by one still works.

#### Part 2

According to my observation, even though the ghosts start at XXAs and continue at XXZs, they still take the same time to loop back to XXZs. This allows the fisrt abuse of LCM in this year's AoC. Find the steps for each ghost to reach XXZ, then use a calculator or something to get the Least Common Multiple. I'm not doing it.
