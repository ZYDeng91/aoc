### Day 9

#### Part 1

So basically taking derivatives, but manually. Follow the problem statement and take derivatives until the whole row is the same (it's necessary because the intermediate derivatives can trick you with several 0s at the beginning and non 0s after). Reverse the operation with a new value equaling to the last of the bottom row, add the last of the bottom-1 row, until the top row is reached.

#### Part 2

The derivatives are the same. Reverse on the left side and get the answer.
