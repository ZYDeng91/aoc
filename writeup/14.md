### Day 14

#### Part 1

'O' rocks are falling towards north. My immediate reaction is we can take '#'s as receivers, i.e. where 'O' rocks end up stopped by, and reconstruct 'O' values using arithmetic series `(start+end)*n/2`. Tranverse the matrix and count how many 'O's falls to each '#'. The border also is also considered as a line of '#'s. Sum up all the arithmetic series and we have the answer.

#### Part 2

Well I definitely didn't see this coming. My implementation does not model the final positition of each rock and reconstructing is inefficient. But then, there is no way we are supposed to rotate *1000000000 cycles* right? I can assume the rotations reach an equilibrium, only repeat itself after a certain time is reached.

I went on to complete the code for other directions and the reconstruction, it is painful I need to rewrite the logics for 3 more times. At least I was quick to notice the question asks for cycles, meaning 1 of each direction.

Printing out all matrices after each cycle will be too verbose, instead we inspect the part 1 load value. Unsuprisingly it starts repeating after 180 cycles, with a period equal to today's date - 14. Now we can simply get the result after (DumbNumber-180)%14+180 cycles.
