### Day 13

#### Part 1

The problem statement can be a bit confusing at some point, my interpretation is: 

> For each pattern if we trim off several rows/cols from a SINGLE side, the shape left is symmetrical, find the line of symmetry, be it horizontal or vertical. The rest is simple arithmetics.

I don't have in mind any refined way to find symmetry. Relying on the assumption that all symmetric shapes are of even length/width, the symmetry center must have 2 identical lines beside it. 

We start by iterating to find such candidates (which fulfills `mat[i-1]==mat[i]`), then spread out to further lines until one edge is reached (`mat[i-1-j]==mat[i+j]`). Problem solved.

I am being lazy here, some shortcuts I took include: 1. direct line/string comparison, instead of element by element (this resulted in some computational inefficiency in part2) 2. transpose the matrix for vertical cases, just to reuse the horizontal code

It also turns out that one shape can only be either horizontal or vertically symmetrical.

#### Part 2

I think here it's better to modify part 1 such that it gives a leeway of 1 character when checking symmetry, and deduce the new result. My part 1 implementation happens to be not ready for this though, so I went with bruteforcing i.e. flipping each char. Luckily the numbers are not big enough to stop me.

There are 2 potential smudges, symmetrical over the new symmetry line. Either one of them works, yet I computed both then took a /2.
