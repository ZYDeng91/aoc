### Day 17

#### Part 1

Although lacking fluency, I can spot this is an A* path finding problem. The obvious thing to do for me is to open up the wiki page and implement the psuedocode I was shown. It did not turn out well though:

Some small mistakes: using a heap data structure is not necessary, I can always write my own max keyof function; the tentative score function f is not necessary as well, I can totally ignore it and it becomes Djisktra's algorithm.

One fatal mistake that took me hours: G score should be given to an ensemble of coordinates AND direction, not just the coordinates. It was a painful self-doubting experience on an algorithm I am not so well versed in.

About the 3-blocks limit, one can simply remove the direction when it is no longer available with a simple `continue`.

The result is the g score of the destination block.

#### Part 2

The limit now has a lowerbound, and the trick in part 1 does not work anymore. I used a much cleaner solution I saw on reddit, which moves 4-10 blocks on one direction altogether, and fill in the g score afterwards (with imagined 1-3 blocks scores).
