### Day 6

#### Part 1

A simple math problem, bruteforcing over time is possible. The only optimization I did is to exploit the symmetry of the parabola, once the first occurence of a time beating the record is found, we can deduce the result being `total time - 2*this time + 1`.

#### Part 2

The time is still not too big, 8 digits is bruteforce-able. No need to call out the quadratic formula.
