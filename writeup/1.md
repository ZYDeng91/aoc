### Day 1 - genesis

#### Part 1

I started with little experience in Go, no prewritten utility functions and this day is when I build everything from scratch.

To warm up, I need a file reader for the input. The one often referenced `os.ReadFile()` does not handle big files well (it tries to read everything as a binary stream?), I could really use a line reader. What comes to mind is `bufio.Scanner`, which effectively replaces a ReadLine function. Now that I can process every line independently.

Iterate through the line to find the first, and the last appearance of a digit. A little conversion from char (rune in proper Go) to int is required, and done by the classic `int(char-'0')`.

#### Part 2

I thought the spelled out pseudo numbers are in place to confuse AI, it turns out I was wrong.

The second part plays a little trick: there are combined numbers, such as `oneight` and `twone`, simply replacing any of them breaks integrity of the other number. We want such cases count as both numbers in order. 

I tried other combinations, it appears only these two cases are exceptions. Replace them with 18 and 21 accordingly, and for what's left replace the spelled number with numerical value. Then we can use part 1's function to get the first and last as usual.

There are smarter solutions to preserve structure integrity of a spelled number's surroundings, examples include replacing them with things like "o1e", "t2o" or "one1one", "two2two" et cetera.
