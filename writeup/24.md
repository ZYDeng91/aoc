### Day 24

Lost to math yet again.

#### Part 1

Well the first part is simple enough, find the point where two lines cross in a 2-D plane. It could be shortened into one line full of math symbols. Check the location against time and the test area, if valid add 1 to the intersection counter.

#### Part 2

I vaguely remember in a 3-D space, only 3 non parallel lines is enough to determine the single line crossing all of them. However this is beyond my imagination to find a viable geometrical solution, and bruteforce does not sound good in this context with such big numbers (it turns out the velocity is still under a small range). 

I turned to reddit for hints, there are disputed claims that this puzzle boils down to a series of 9 equations, with 9 unknowns, if you write all 3 hailstones colliding the rock at an unknown time into equations. Then put them into some math solver engines, leave the heavylifting to WolframAlpha. It could be solvable by pen and paper if anyone is patient enough to deal with 9 unknown variables.

For some reason I keep getting errors, rejections or wrong answers on modern math engines hosted online, so I figured I could do it on my end. MATLAB is one popular choice, yet I prefer GNU Octave with the symbols package. It solves the equations near instantly, contrary to what I expected of long minutes mentioned by redditors. This constitutes the first non-Go solution I used in this year's AoC.
