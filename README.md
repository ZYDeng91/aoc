# Advent Of Code 2023

Archiving my ideas and prompts about the yearly event [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

2023 is my 1st year into AoC, and this is my 1st hands-on adventure with Golang (I don't have what it takes to play competitive). Not gonna clean up the code since they are reflective of my thought process, instead I will try to provide writeups of how I solved each problem. Enjoy!
