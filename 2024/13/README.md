### Day 13 - What?

#### Part 1 & 2

I got so confused into overthinking linear algebra is not a day13 difficulty.

Solvable on paper. The input adding 1x10^14 does not change the O(1) time complexity for each machine.

I had a few "What?" moments even though I had the solution in my hands, one being parser ignoring last entry because there is no 4th empty row, the other being not checking correctness of divisions. Go automatically rounds quotients into integers, yeah...
