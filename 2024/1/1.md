### Day 1 - Too Long; Didn't Read

#### Pt 1

For some reasons my 1st instinct is to use heaps. Quick copy&paste for a premade IntHeap example, push, pop, stuff. Solve. Probably spent the most time parsing and figuring out how to type assert from any to int.

The `sort` package, which I forgot, could be a better solution, as a second thought.

#### Pt 2

Actually easier than pt.1 since no sorting is required. The right column now becomes an occurence counting map. Old tricks. Should've been faster on my end.
