### Day 18 - Time

Line parser. Split by ','.

#### Part 1

Pathfinding. Recycle day 16's Dijkstra.

Of course I had to spend time setting up everything in anticipation for part 2. I thought there is going to be bytes falling for each tick/step when you are moving or something, but there isn't.

#### Part 2

My part 1 is fast enough to let me do a simple binary search manually to find the result. I had to double check my answer is exactly the 3,000th byte.

It really is nothing, huh.
