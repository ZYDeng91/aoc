### Day 11

#### Part 1

In this universe, the distance between galaxies can be universally (duh) expressed as `abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)`, whether before or after the expansion. Finding empty rows/cols is simple and can be done in various ways. Give new coordinates to the galaxies after the expansion (alternatively, modify the distance function). Knowing the coordinates of galaxies, find every pair using `i:=0;i<len(galaxies)-1;i++` and `j:=i+1;j<len(galaxies);j++` loops and we have the total.

#### Part 2

Big numbers does not scare me. As long as the coordinates are not implemented in an actual matrix (that would be several millions of size), changing the constant multiplier of the expanding universe and it will suffice.
