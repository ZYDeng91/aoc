### Day 4

Up until this day, the puzzles are proved (by reddit) still solvable with Vim keystrokes.

#### Part 1

Simply divide each card into left and right sections. Split them with blankspaces to turn them into lists of numbers.

Then for each number in the left, compare it with each number in the right, add 1 to a counter if they matches. Afterwards return the total matches from the card. Take power of 2 and sum up to get the result.

#### Part 2

It certainly is less viable to physically replicate each card memory-wise. One alternate is to add a weight/multiplier to the index of each card, which started with 1 for all cards.  Number of new replicates resulted from a card's matches will be influenced by its own multiplier. Keep the list going, in the end apart from matches, we also have a list of multipliers of each card. Sum up the multipliers and we have the total number of scratch cards.
