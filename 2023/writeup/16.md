### Day 16

#### Part 1

The puzzle today is like a fusion between day 10 and day 12. Some code & ideas can be reused.

Start at top-left and pointing right, we can always get the direction of the next move based on the tile it landed on, branch if needed. In the puzzle's assumption there is no terminate condition, the light could remain in a loop forever. We should keep track of such beams by tracking if they are energizing new tiles, and terminate them when adequate.

Notice there are cases when a tile is energized multiple times. Since we don't want to overshadow the late-coming light beams and mistakenly terminate them, we can set a threshold, such that when a beam consecutively land on energized tiles for turns more than the threshold, we can finally terminate it. This avoids both early termination and looping infinitely. I used a threshold of 100 and it just works.

After all the light beams no longer energize new tiles, count the energized tiles.

#### Part 2

Part 1 is general enough to cover most of part 2, loop through the new starting positions/directions and compare. Result is the max.
