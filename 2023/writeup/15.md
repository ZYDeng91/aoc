### Day 15

#### Part 1

Parse and HASH, nothing much. The rune type in golang using ASCII as value is convinient.

#### Part 2

Interesting to see this part 2 deviates so far from part 1, leaving the latter only as a helper function. The HASHMAP hint is strong. Yet I still got lost on the box indexing, only to find out the box index is equal to the part 1 hash of the label. Out of 256 they really could use better examples.

There are now '-' and '=', two types of operations. My approach is to use 2 maps, one for focal length indexed by label (`map[string]int`), and the other for in-box slots indexed by box number (`map[int][]string`). For '-' we can simply take out the label from the slot and reset its focal length, and for '=' we can modify the focal length, and append to the box if not present (indicated by a 0 focal length).

Loop through the boxes' content, multiply and sum up.
