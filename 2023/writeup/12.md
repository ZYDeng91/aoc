### Day 12

This is the first day I struggled a lot, and cannot finish on my own. Still a very good puzzle, for it perfectly exposed my rusty knowledge in recursion and dynamic programming.

#### Part 1

So I was thinking I can divide each row into groups of possible springs, then try to fit in the required sizes. I just sat there for hours clueless about what to do next, until I gave up, peeked reddit and realized this is a Dynamic Programming problem.

I see many people bruteforcing the first part, enumerating every `?` being `.` or `#`. The time complexity for each row O(2<sup>n</sup>) is scary, but bearable under this context. Say an usual row has 12 `?`s, it would result in 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 new rows to be examined, which is still doable.

#### Part 2

The second part totally blocks off any attempt to bruteforce. Join the rows with 4 `?`s in between, the exponential time complexity no longer fits the new input. First we employ a more efficient algorithm, recursively iterate through the springs and patterns, treat `?` as both `.` and `#`. The terminate conditions check the validity of the `?` branches, return 0 if the patterns are either not satisfied or exceeded, return 1 otherwise.

It's not over yet, the solution still takes forever to run. To further speed up, we introduce a new cache variable (memoization), such that the latter parts of the record-pattern combinations don't have to be repeatedly calculated.

In the end the run time is cut down to 0.53s.
