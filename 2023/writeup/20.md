### Day 20

#### Part 1

How the modules interact may look scary, but we can boil down into one universal principle: when a module receives a signal, its output is decided by the state of the signal sender. We can hypothetically give states to conjunction modules to indicate their signal sent.

In this narrative, flip-flop modules sends high if it's on, and low otherwise. Conjunction modules sends low if and only if all modules listening are on, and high otherwise. There is no need to categorize signals internally as low and high, instead we can just check senders' state and process the logic. Maintain a count of high/low signal pulses sent.

The order of pulses matter, meaning we can implement this as a turn-based message-queue-esque to-do list. One thing to notice is conjunction modules should be processed with higher priority in the list.

#### Part 2

Try out some big numbers and you will realize this is yet another LCM problem. By manually examining the broadcast button and its relations (this gets confusing easily), there are four modules fv, kk, vt, xr indirectly relates to "rx", and we get a low pulse to rx when the four horsemen all sent high (during the same button press). Observe the period when each of them do so, find the LCM of them and here we have it.
