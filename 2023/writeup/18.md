### Day 18

Today's puzzle is strongly reminiscent of day 10's, except this one is all math.

#### Part 1

The numbers are small and the color code does not matter, basically a low hanging fruit. Manually stepping and floodfill is possible.

#### Part 2

The last days of AoC puzzles deviated the foci from programming to math, I am suprised. Different from previous days when we divide a huge number into repetitions, this time we can have the result directly. Mathematically we can calculate the area of a polygon knowing its coordinates, let alone in this case there are no diagonal lines. Using the Shoelace Theorem, the problem is reduced to arithmetics. Apart from the math solution, don't forget the borders has their weights.

The result of the shoelace arithmetics does not always result in a positive, so we should take the absolute, and finally add on the border blocks.
