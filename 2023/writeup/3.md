### Day 3

#### Part 1

Find numbers (consecutive digits), find their length, crop their surrondings and check every tile for symbols. Not the best solution but the first I came up with.

I spent a lot of time understanding how to find numbers from found digits. I guess this is what you have to endure when you are new.

#### Part 2

Alter the process from part 1: find gears, then find their surronding digits, find numbers where the digits belong. If there are exactly two, multiply them and add to result.

Interestingly, even though I never not notice not all symbols, but only `*`s are gears, I still got the correct answer. It turns out other symbols never add to the result when treated as gears, after all.

As an afterthought, the part 2 way of handling (find numbers around symbols) seems both more efficient and more general than what I did for part 1.
