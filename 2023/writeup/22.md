### Day 22

#### Part 1

The inital z/height of the bricks are not representative of their actual z position, we should give them new z coords. And the overlapping bricks at (0, 0, 10) in the explanation makes me want to do a sanity check.

We can take an upside-down perspective. The bricks are now in a 10x10 grid (x and y both are 0~9). Sort bricks with z so we can decide which ones fall first. In the grid, determine what squares the falling brick is going to cover, and for those squares (which corresponds to bricks), find which brick has the highest z, which the falling brick is going to land on. Afterwards determine the new z of the falling brick, and the landing squares are now covered with the new brick.

Let this go on, the bricks will be sorted. During the falling we can keep track of the dependency of each brick. Since we know the list of bricks and all the dependencies, the non-fatal-dependency (i.e. not 1 to 1 dependency) bricks are safe to disintegrate.

#### Part 2

This is a chain reaction. For each brick removed, there are other bricks influenced/removed, and that could result in other bricks falling, and so on. My bruteforce-ish solution is to one-by-one remove fallen bricks from the dependency map, and if one brick has no dependency left it will fall. Loop until no bricks are removed, and we have the number of bricks that would fall. Sum up and we have the result.
