### Day 5

#### Part 1

The conversion maps are nothing scary. They're merely repetitions of the same process. Each row of the maps consists of 3 values: destination, source and range. For any input, loop through the map until the input's numeric value is in between source and source+range, and return input-source+destination. If the input failed to fit in any of the rows, return the input directly.

For a seed number, convert through the list of maps to get its corresponding location number. Compare the results and return the lowest.

#### Part 2

It is a bad idea to individually examine every single seed number, considering there are various ideas to reduce the workload. The standard, general solution should be to reorganize all the maps into a single one, then either by mathematically evaluate local minimum for each section or by picking the border numbers, and find the lowest. This makes the time complexity no longer linearly relate to the seeds size.

My solution, a rather hacky one, is to increase the step size over the seed ranges. This is under the assumption that the likelyhood of missing a whole section within one increased step is negligible. In specific, I increased the step to 1000, reducing the seeds size to 1/1000th. Roughly evaluate the lowest point, and around it, make a more precise range of +-1000 with a step of 1 to find the real lowest point.
