### Day 2

#### Part 1

From yesterday's read file function, today's task introduces an addition to the toolset: a parser, i.e. RegEx. At least I had some experience in it before, surely it won't do me wrong.

For every row, extract every `number+space+[rgb]` combination using RegEx. Examine each number-color pair, if any fails the limit (i.e. r<=12, g<=13, b<=14), the row is discarded.

Sum up the IDs of the valid games left.

#### Part 2

For every valid row, record the highest r,g,b seen, multiply them and add to the result.
