### Day 19

#### Part 1

Initially I wanted to make worksflows as lambda functions and make a map of workflows, but later on I decided not to bring in extra complexity. I split workflows into operations, failing the condition check moves the pointer to the next operation in the workflow. What's left is to let the input flow in.

#### Part 2

Kinda tricky but still doable, took me a long time though. It is impossible to individually check all the possible combinations, but it is possible to keep track of ranges (4-D blocks). We can define two variables, start and end, as the starting range. For each condition check, instead of checking, we split the range into branches, one is true and one is false. Then we can split these subdivision of ranges into deeper layers of conditions, until any dimension having start\<end. This way we can have all ranges landing on "A" in the end nonrepetitively, for each range the number of combinations is the sum of the multiplication of each letter's end-start. Sum up and here we have it.
